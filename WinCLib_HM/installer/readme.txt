This software requires Visual Studio to be installed! If Visual Studio is not installed it is not possible to install the project templates. The project templates make it more easy to use the SDK. It is possible to rerun the installation (no uninstall required) to install the Visual Studio integration. 

The Visual Studio template is named "HM FK4 TI3 - C Project" and can be found via the search bar when creating a new project.
